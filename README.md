#  Half a Sentence
Deployed at https://half-a-sentence.herokuapp.com/


### Inspiration

"Some sentences just finish off themselves..." 

A friend of mine said this to me once. I liked the idea of finishing off sentences. I liked the idea of having strangers finish off sentences. I liked the idea of doing this under time pressure. - This will be a fun project!


### Description

Visitors to the website are prompted with the "first-half" of a sentence. Users must finish off the sentence under time constraints. This is done to capture the first thing that comes to ones mind and to reduce the risk of 'over-thinking'.

After users submit their sentence halfs (tails), they are redirected to a page with all the other annonymous submissions to that "first half". Each user is then allowed to upvote their favourite result once. The most upvoted sentences will appear on the top. This "first-half" changes daily, cycling through a database. Eventually "first half" sentences will be user submitted.
